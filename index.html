     <h2>About Me!</h2>

        <p>The thing that peaked my interest and <em>passion</em> into sofware engineering was my last career. Before <strong>Covid-19</strong> I was a class A Cdl truck driver and I had my own web page made for me. I worked very closely with the developers, I got to see how awesome it was to create things with a few key strokes. After working with them i was hooked!</p>
        <p>Another thing I really like about wed design is that it is a team effort, I played team sports my entire life and even in college. Being able to work on a team again is extremely awesome, I'm very excited to be able to gain new knowledge from working on a team; and to share my knowledge with my fellow team mates as well. </p>
        <p>I also enjoy traveling, with my family, playing/watching sports and cooking. </p>
