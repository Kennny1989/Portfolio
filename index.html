    <article>
        <p>The thing that peaked my interest and <em>passion</em> into sofware engineering was my last career. Before <strong>Covid-19</strong> I was a class A Cdl truck driver and I had my own web page made for me. I worked very closely with the developers, I got to see how awesome it was to create things with a few key strokes. After working with them i was hooked!</p>
